Challenge #6 - 5 Day Weather Forecast Dashboard

## Task
- Create a weather app that shows a 5-day forecast
- Incorporate local storage and search history that can functionally render the weather for a particular city
- When given a city, user wants icon, temp, wind, and humidity for current day and 5 days out

## Process
- Obtain weather lat/long for given city using openweather API
- Obtain weather data for given city using lat/long obtained from previous endpoint
- Build multiple functions in JavaScript to handle the diffent data we will get from API
- Combine functions with the event listener in order to render the data in a polished format for the user

## What I Learned
- I learned how to utilize local storage in a more practical way, and how to incorporate it into functions
- I learned how to properly call on an API, find data that I needed, and distribute that data using a function
- Finally, I learned that is possible to combine two API calls in order to interpolate data from one call to another
